# Cognitive Assistant - Dream Project 🌟

> **A Vision for Privacy-First AI** - This is my dream project still in development. Join me on this journey to create a truly private AI assistant that runs entirely on local devices.

## 💭 The Vision

Imagine an AI assistant that:
- **Respects Your Privacy**: All processing happens locally on your device
- **Works Offline**: No internet required for core functionality  
- **Controls Your Smart Home**: Seamless IoT integration (planned)
- **Schedules Intelligently**: AI-powered calendar management (in development)
- **Converses Naturally**: Real-time, contextual conversations (prototype stage)

## 🔬 Current Development Status

This project is currently in **early development phase**. Here's what's happening:

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Project vision and planning
- [x] Initial website and branding
- [x] Technology stack research
- [x] Basic prototype architecture

### 🚧 In Progress  
- [ ] Local LLM integration and optimization
- [ ] Hardware platform setup (NVIDIA Jetson Nano)
- [ ] Core AI conversation engine
- [ ] Privacy-first architecture implementation

### 🎯 Planned Features
- [ ] Smart home device integration
- [ ] Intelligent scheduling system
- [ ] Voice command processing
- [ ] OTA update system
- [ ] Mobile companion app

## 🛠 Planned Technology Stack

### Target Hardware
- **NVIDIA Jetson Nano**: For edge AI computing
- **Custom Hardware**: Optimized for local AI inference

### AI Models (Research Phase)
- **Local LLMs**: Exploring Llama 2, Mistral 7B, and custom models
- **NLP Pipeline**: Intent recognition and natural language processing

### Connectivity (Future)
- **IoT Integration**: Zigbee, Z-Wave, WiFi, Bluetooth LE
- **Mesh Networking**: Thread and Matter compatibility

### Current Web Interface
- **Next.js 15.3.3**: React-based framework
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Modern styling  
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development

## 🎨 Why This Matters

In a world where AI assistants send your conversations to the cloud, we're building something different:

- **Your Data Stays Yours**: No cloud processing, no data collection
- **Privacy by Design**: Built from the ground up with privacy as a core principle
- **True Ownership**: You control your AI assistant completely
- **Innovation Freedom**: Open to explore new possibilities without corporate constraints
